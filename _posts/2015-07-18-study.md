Review Stuff
------------------------------

Using the command 

```
data <- read.csv(file="filename", header=TRUE, sep=",")
```
reads in the csv filename into the dataframe data. 

For loops can be given as 

```
for( i in 1:20)
{
#do something
}
```
In order to produce a good histogram use ``` hist(data,break="FD")``` as this spacing seems to look the best. FD stands for using the Freedman-Diaconis rule to create the bin size, where we set the bin size to

$$
2\frac{IQR(x)}{\sqrt[3]{n}}
$$

In order to run a Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test for a normal distribution with mean $x$ and standard deviation $y$ do

```
ks.test(data, "pnorm", x,y)
```


Just seeing if this changes anything.
