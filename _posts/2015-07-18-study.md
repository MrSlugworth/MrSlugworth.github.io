Review Stuff
------------------------------

Using the command 

```
data <- read.csv(file="filename", header=TRUE, sep=",")
```
reads in the csv filename into the dataframe data. 

For loops can be given as 

```
for( i in 1:20)
{
#do something
}
```
In order to produce a good histogram use ```hist(data,break="FD")`` as this spacing seems to look the best. FD stands for using the Freedman-Diaconis rule to create the bin size, where we set 

$sere$

Just seeing if this changes anything.
