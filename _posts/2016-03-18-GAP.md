What I did when I worked with GAP
------------------------------

Using the command 

```
sh bin/gap.sh
```
starts the GAP prompt. 


Running
```
IrreducibleRepresentations(SmallGroup(a,b));
```
returns a list of maps which are the irreducible representations of the group ```SmallGroup(a,b)``` from the SmallGroup Library.
