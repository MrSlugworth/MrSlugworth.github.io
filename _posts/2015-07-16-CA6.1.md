Characters of Finite Abelian Groups
--------------------------

In this post we discuss the characters of finite abelian groups. 

**Definition** Let $$G$$ be a finite abelian group then a character $$\chi$$ of $$G$$ is a homomorphism $$\chi: G\rightarrow \mathbb{C}^*$$. 

We will show a number of things about Characters
