Let $$K$$ be a field of characteristic $$p\neq 0$$. Define $$\sigma(x)=x^p$$, this map is called the Frobenius endomorphism of $$K$$. 
---------------------------------------------
**Proposition** The map $$\sigma$$ is an injective endomorphism of $$K$$ onto one of its subfields $$K^p$$. 

---------------------------------------------
**Proof:** To check that $$\sigma(x+y)=\sigma(x)+\sigma(y)$$, use the divisibility of the binomial coefficients. That $$\sigma(x)\sigma(y)=\sigma(xy)$$ is obvious. So, this map is an endomorphism. Then to see that this map is injective note that if $$\sigma(x)-\sigma(y)=0$$, then we have that 

$$
0=x^p+y^p=(x+y)^p,
$$

so, $$x+y$$ is equal to $$0$$ as $$K$$ is a field. $$\qed$$.
