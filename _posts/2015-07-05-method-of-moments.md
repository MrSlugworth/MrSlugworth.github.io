**Theorem (Stability of ESD laws wrt small rank perturbations)**[^1] 

Let $$M_n$$ be a sequence of random hermitian matrix ensembles such that $$\mu_{\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}}M_n$$ converges almost surely to a limit $$\mu$$.
Let $$N_n$$ be another sequence of random matrix ensembles suhc that $$\frac{1}{n}\text{rank}(N_n)$$ converges almost surely to zero. Then $$\mu_{\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}(M_n+N_n}$$
 converges almost surely to $$\mu$$. The same claim holds if "almost surely" is replaced by "in probability" or "in expectation" throughout.
