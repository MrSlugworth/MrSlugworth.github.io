---------------------------------------------
A group, $$G$$, in which every element has order $$2$$ is abelian.

---------------------------------------------
**Proof:** Note that for every $$a\in G$$, we have that $$a^{-1}=a$$, then $$ab=(ab)^{-1}=b^{-1}a^{-1}=ba$$. Thus the group is abelian.
